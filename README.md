# Flights Management System

## Overview

Welcome to the FEUPFlights. This C++ program is designed to streamline the management of flights using graphs. The project focuses on functionalities such as searching for airports, air companies, and specific flights. Additionally, the system allows users to identify nearby airports using a coordinate system and determine the optimal flight options with the least number of connections using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The development of this program is an essential component of the curriculum for the [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=501673) course.

## Key Features

* **Airport Search:** Look up information about specific airports.
* **Air Company Exploration:** Explore details about various air companies.
* **Flight Inquiry:** Search for specific flights and their details.
* **Coordinate System:** Identify nearby airports using a coordinate system.
* **Optimal Flights:** Utilize BFS to find flight options with the least number of connections.
